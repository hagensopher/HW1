I completed the assigment

I have pretty large main file for Q2. This is because it contains all the code needed for Q2 and Q3
There are specified blocks of code in the main that can be commented and uncommented to run the different parts.
I tried to labled them all to show where one starts and ends.
If you have any questions I know it works so please reach out to me at

A question I have on the assigment is why use the node iterator
when if i makde the linked list i can just loop through that
It seems overly complicated to loop through both.
Is the node iterator only used for when using a for-each loop? and we just made our own?
